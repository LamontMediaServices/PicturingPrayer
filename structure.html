                            <h3>The first part of a book of hours is a perpetual calendar, i.e., a calendar that can be used year after year.  Major feast days are frequently distinguished by a different color of ink, sometimes gold, but more often red (hence the phrase &ldquo;red-letter days&rdquo;). Local saints days are frequently included in calendars and are a good indication of where any given book of hours was intended to be used.  The calendar could also be used to record the births and deaths (obits) of family members of owners.</h3>
                            <h3>Other columns in the calendar include Roman calendrical dates (Nones, Kalends, Ides), and Golden Numbers (i-ix, linked to the cycles of the moon) and Dominical Letters (a-g) used to determine the all-important date of Easter, which is a variable feast.</h3>
                            <h3>Calendars are often illustrated by signs of the zodiac and traditional labors of the month. They are also characterized by distinctive patterns of ruling to accommodate the information they provide to readers.</h3></div>

They are: John 1:1-14 (Christmas), Luke 1:26-38 (Annunciation), Matthew 2:1-12 (Epiphany) and Mark 16:14-20 (Ascension). Sometimes only the reading from the gospel of John is included and sometimes these readings are illustrated by author portraits of the four evangelists, each with their respective symbol, based on early Christian readings of the Old Testament prophet, Ezechiel 1 (Matthew, the winged man; Mark, the lion; Luke, the ox; and John, the eagle).</h3></div>

                            <h3>The Hours of the Virgin are the central text in any book of hours. Each hour is composed of various antiphons and responses, psalms, hymns, canticles and prayers addressed to the Virgin Mary and appealing for her intercession. There are eight such hours in a day and they are meant to be used at seven different times during the day. Matins and Lauds at day break; Prime at 6 am.; Terce at 9 am.; Sext at noon; None at 3 pm.; Vespers at sunset and Compline before going to bed. Illustrations frequently depict joyous events in the Virgins life connected with the infancy of Christ. These include: Matins: Annunciation, Lauds: Visitation, Prime: Nativity, Terce: Annunciation to the Shepherds, Sext: Adoration of the Magi, None: Presentation in the temple, Vespers: Flight into Egypt and Compline: Coronation of the Virgin.  This traditional infancy cycle is sometimes replaced, especially in manuscripts produced in fifteenth-century England, Flanders and the Netherlands, by another cycle which depicts the Passion of Christ.  In MS Richardson 34, for example, Matins is illustrated by the Annunciation, but Lauds through Compline is illustrated by events between the Betrayal and the Entombment.</h3></div>

                            <h3>The suffrages are arranged in an order that reflects the heavenly hierarchy: the Trinity, the Virgin Mary and Michael the Archangel, John the Baptist, apostles, male martyrs and confessors (saints who died of natural causes), female martyrs and widows.</h3>
                            
                            <h3>The number of suffrages and the saint to whom they are addressed can vary widely, but can give indications of the place of origin of the manuscript or the individual for whom it was made.</h3>

Two prayers, &ldquo;<em>Obsecro te</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>O intemerata</em>,&rdquo; are regularly included.  Variations in their wording can also help determine issues of localization.  These popular prayers were also often illustrated. The first is addressed to the Virgin Mary and the second to the Virgin Mary and to St. John the Evangelist, the beloved disciple. Both prayers plead for their intercession with Christ.

Along with devotion to Mary as intercessor, the Passion formed one of the principal foci of late medieval piety and devotion and hence often receives extensive elaboration in books of hours.</h3></div>
